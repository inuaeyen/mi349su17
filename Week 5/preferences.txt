This bar is bright colored and attracts attention so the user sees it easier than in Tile2. I believe the mock up works best for me however because it shows an image of what your webpage should look like at the end. I can now work towards that preferred image on the mock up. I can get by with just the style tile but the mock up makes it easier for me to work towards my web page. I spent a little over 1 hour on the style tiles and 3 hours on the photoshop mock up.}
